## Build tools
 
The project uses Webpack for its build tools, which can be configured in `webpack.config.js`.
 
The project is configured to include the following:

- Babel support
- SASS support
- File loader (enables assets, e.g. imgs and svgs, to be used)
- Local server

The project has two npm scripts:

1. `start` - opens a local server and loads the app, watching for any changes
2. `build` - builds a version of app into the `dist` folder
